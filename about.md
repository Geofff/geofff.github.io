I'm an student, currently studying my Masters of Professional Engineering at the University of Western Australia.


My major focus is in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, but I have a strong interest in low level software, especially embedded software. 

Some of my projects are posted on this site, with some being posted over on my Github page. {% include icon-github.html username="geofff" %}

My Resume is available [for download here]({{site.url}}/assets/Resume-Geoffrey-Channon.pdf)
